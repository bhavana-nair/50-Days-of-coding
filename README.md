# 50-Days-of-coding

Day 1:  
290. Word Pattern  
Given a pattern and a string s, find if s follows the same pattern. Here follow means a full match, such that there is a bijection between a letter in pattern and a non-empty word in s.  
1Two Sum  
Given an array of integers nums and an integer target, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to target. You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice. You can return the answer in any order.  
  
Day 2:  
520. Detect Capital  
We define the usage of capitals in a word to be right when one of the following cases holds:All letters in this word are capitals, like "USA".All letters in this word are not capitals, like "leetcode".Only the first letter in this word is capital, like "Google".Given a string word, return true if the usage of capitals in it is right.   
9. Palindrome Number  
Given an integer x, return true if x is a palindrome, and false otherwise.  
  
Day 3:  
944. Delete Columns to Make Sorted  
You are given an array of n strings strs, all of the same length.The strings can be arranged such that there is one on each line, making a grid. For example, strs = ["abc", "bce", "cae"] can be arranged as:  
abc  
bce  
cae  
You want to delete the columns that are not sorted lexicographically. In the above example (0-indexed), columns 0 ('a', 'b', 'c') and 2 ('c', 'e', 'e') are sorted while column 1 ('b', 'c', 'a') is not, so you would delete column 1. Return the number of columns that you will delete.  
13. Roman to Integer  
Given a roman numeral, convert it to an integer.
