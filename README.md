Day 1:  
290. Word Pattern  
Given a pattern and a string s, find if s follows the same pattern. Here follow means a full match, such that there is a bijection between a letter in pattern and a non-empty word in s.  
1Two Sum  
Given an array of integers nums and an integer target, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to target. You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice. You can return the answer in any order.
